<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me and my research</h3>

<p>I am
a <a href="http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research/">Royal
Society University Research Fellow</a> and Reader in Astrophysics
based in
the <a href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/research/stri/research-areas/car.html">Centre
for Astrophysics Research (CAR) at the University of
Hertfordshire</a>. I studied Physics at Imperial College London as an
undergraduate, and then did my Ph.D. at Durham University under the
expert tutelage of <a href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~irs/">Ian
Smail</a>. After completing my thesis, I was a post-doc at Durham
and <a href="http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html">Banting
Fellow</a>
at <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/index.php">McGill
University</a> before coming to CAR in 2013.

<p>My research generally focuses on the formation and evolution of
galaxies and observational cosmology, but I also investigate novel
uses of machine learning in astrophysics and explore the application
of these techniques in other fields, including medicine and
agriculture. I like to dabble.</p>

<p>For a complete record of my research, you can find
an <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-basic_connect?qsearch=geach%2C+j&version=1">up-to-date
listing of publications and pre-prints at the NASA Astrophysics Data
System</a>. You can also read about some of my research in the

<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing</h3>

<p>I like trying to break down complex ideas into simple language,
with a goal of explaining the cutting edge of astronomical research in
a way that anyone can understand. I have written two popular science
books, both published
by <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk">Reaktion Books</a>:

<br>

<br><a href="galaxy.html"><img src='i/cover.jpg'></a>&nbsp<a href="fivephotons.html"><img src='i/fivephotons.jpg'></a><br>
</p>

<p>I have written feature articles
for <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-galaxies"><i>Scientific
American</i></a> and <a href="https://www.skyandtelescope.com/sky-and-telescope-magazine/inside-april-2018-issue/"><i>Sky & Telescope</i></a>. I regularly contribute
to <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/james-geach-206318/articles"><i>The
Conversation</i></a> and also write the occasional piece
on <a href="https://medium.com/@jgeach">Medium</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="viz" class="anchor" href="#viz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h3>

<a href="http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~crain/">Rob Crain</a> and
myself have been developing a set of tools to create bespoke
visualizations of cosmological simulations and volumetric
observational data. Our work has appeared on the front cover
of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09452.html"><i>Nature</i></a>
and <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Scientific
American</i></a>, and we also contributed to Terrence Malick's incredible <a href="https://voyageoftime.imax.com/"><i>Voyage Of Time</i>
