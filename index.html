<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me and my research</h3>

<p>I am
a <a href="http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research/">Royal
Society University Research Fellow</a> based in
the <a href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/research/stri/research-areas/car.html">Centre
for Astrophysics Research (CAR) at the University of
Hertfordshire</a>. I did my Ph.D. at Durham University under the
expert tutelage of <a href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~irs/">Ian
Smail</a>. After graduating, I was a post-doc at Durham
and <a href="http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html">Banting
Fellow</a>
at <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/index.php">McGill
University</a> before coming to CAR in 2013.

<p> My research focuses on the evolution of galaxies, with a special
emphasis on obscured activity, the role of environment, and the
properties and evolution of cold gas in and around galaxies. For a
complete record of my research, you can find
an <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-basic_connect?qsearch=geach%2C+j&version=1">up-to-date
listing of publications and pre-prints at the NASA Astrophysics Data
System</a>.

<p>Some of my research in the press:<br>

<p> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Galaxy-Mapping-Cosmos-James-Geach/dp/1780233639"><i>Galaxy: Mapping The Cosmos</i></a> is published
by <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/reaktion/display.asp?ISB=9781780233635&m=28&dc=746">Reaktion

<p>Some praise for <i>Galaxy</i>:</p>
<p><blockquote>James Geach is actively researching on one of the most exciting
frontiers of today’s science: extragalactic astronomy. His book
conveys his personal enthusiasm, and offers a clear and highly
readable survey of the field’s progress and prospects.</blockquote><br> Professor
Martin Rees FRS, Astronomer Royal, Institute of Astronomy,
Cambridge</p>

<p><blockquote>Dr Geach brings his personal experience to the fore in
describing the latest discoveries in this rapidly developing field of
cosmology and galaxy evolution . . . I highly recommend this book for
those wanting to share in the excitement of modern
astronomy.</blockquote><br> Professor Richard Ellis FRS, California Institute
of Technology</p>

<p><blockquote>Galaxies are the building blocks of the Universe. But they are
dynamic blocks that have changed and evolved throughout the 13 billion
years since their seeds – sown at the very instant of the Big Bang –
began to grow. Their trials and tribulations are recounted with great
clarity in this short, accessible, yet deep and comprehensve
book. What are galaxies made of, why do they have different sizes,
luminosities and morphologies, how have they managed to grow gigantic
black holes in their midst, all these questions are posed – and
answered as far as current knowledge permits – in an engaging and
absorbing way by James Geach. As a practising professional astronomer
at the cutting edge of galaxy research, Geach has managed to convey
the vibrancy and excitement of research at the very forefront of human
knowledge.</blockquote><br> Professor Carlos Frenk FRS, Director of the Institute for
Computational Cosmology, Durham University</p>


<h3><a name="writing" class="anchor"

></span></a>Articles and features</h3>

<p>Check
out <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-galaxies">"The
Lost Galaxies"</a>, a feature article I wrote for <i>Scientific
American.</i>This article looks at the issue of 'missing baryons', or
the inefficiency of galaxy formation from the standpoint of where most
of the gas in the Universe ended up. This article was also featured in
the August 2014 Special Edition of <i>Scientific American</i>
titled <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Secrets
of the Universe: past, present and future</a></i></p>

<p>I also write the occasional piece
on <a href="https://medium.com/@jgeach">Medium</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="viz" class="anchor" href="#viz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h3>

<a href="http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~crain/">Rob Crain</a> and
myself have been developing a set of tools to create bespoke
visualizations of cosmological simulations and volumetric
observational data. We have created fully stereoscopic IMAX-scale
movies, and our work has appeared on the front cover
of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09452.html"><i>Nature</i></a>
and <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Scientific
American</i></a>. A few examples of our work:
