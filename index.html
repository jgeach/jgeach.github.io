<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief</h3>

<p>I am
a <a href="http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research/">Royal
Society University Research Fellow</a> based in
the <a href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/research/stri/research-areas/car.html">Centre
for Astrophysics Research (CAR) at the University of
Hertfordshire</a>. I did my Ph.D. at Durham University under the
expert tutelage of <a href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~irs/">Ian
Smail</a>. After graduating, I was a post-doc at Durham
and <a href="http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html">Banting
Fellow</a>
at <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/index.php">McGill
University</a> before coming to CAR in 2013.

<p> My research focuses on the evolution of galaxies, with a special
emphasis on obscured activity, the role of environment, and the
properties and evolution of cold gas in and around galaxies. For a
complete record of my research, you can find
an <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-basic_connect?qsearch=geach%2C+j&version=1">up-to-date
listing of publications and pre-prints at the NASA Astrophysics Data
System</a>.

<h3><a name="writing" class="anchor" href="#writing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Popular writing</h3>

<p>I am the author of <strong>Galaxy: mapping the cosmos </strong> published by <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/reaktion/display.asp?ISB=9781780233635&m=28&dc=746">Reaktion Books</a>.

<p>Check
out <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-galaxies">"The
Lost Galaxies"</a>, a feature article I wrote for <i>Scientific
American.</i>This article looks at the issue of 'missing baryons', or
the inefficiency of galaxy formation from the standpoint of where most
of the gas in the Universe ended up. This article was also featured in
the August 2014 Special Edition of <i>Scientific American</i>
titled <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Secrets
of the Universe: past, present and future</a></i></p>

<h3><a name="viz" class="anchor" href="#viz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h3>

<a href="http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~crain/">Rob Crain</a> and myself have
been developing a set of tools to create bespoke visualizations of
cosmological simulations and volumetric observational data. We have created
fully stereoscopic IMAX-scale movies, and our work has appeared on the front
cover of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09452.html"><i>Nature</i></a>. A
few examples of our work:
