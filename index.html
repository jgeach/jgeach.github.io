<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief</h3>

<p>I am an astronomer based in the <a
href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/research/stri/research-areas/car.html">Centre for
Astrophysics Research (CAR) at the University of Hertfordshire</a>.</p>

<p>I did my Ph.D. at Durham University under the expert tutelage of <a
href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~irs/">Ian Smail</a>. I was a post-doc at
Durham and <a
href="http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html">Banting
Fellow</a> at <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/index.php">McGill
University</a> before coming to CAR.

<p> My research focuses on the evolution of galaxies, with a special emphasis
on obscured activity, the role of environment, and the properties and
evolution of cold gas in galaxies. For a complete record of my research, you
can find an <a

<h3><a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>I lead or co-lead the following projects:

<li><i>VISTA-CFHT Stripe 82 survey (VICS82):</i> a 180 square degree J and
K(short) imaging survey of the SDSS Stripe 82 to a depth of 22 mag (AB). Our
aims are to accurately measure the stellar mass function of galaxies and
clusters out to z~1 in a 0.5 cubic-Gpc volume, detect intermediate redshift
(and very high redshift) quasars, find distant clusters and proto-clusters of
galaxies and to perform CMB-OIR cross correlation experiments. Basically
contributing to the growing legacy of data in the SDSS Stripe 82 region. </li>

<br>

 <li><i>SCUBA-2 Cluster Snapshot Survey (S2CSS):</i> a Band 4+5 SCUBA-2
project targeting 100s of massive clusters of galaxies to hunt for the
brightest (lensed) submillimetre galaxies in the sky. Ideal ALMA targets to
learn about the properties of cold gas and dust in distant galaxies with
incredible signal-to-noise and spatial resolution.</li>

</p>

<p>I am the survey scientist of the <i>SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey
(S2CLS)</i> - the largest of the JCMT Legacy Surveys. S2CLS is performing the
most comprehensive survey of submillimetre galaxies ever done, potentially
detecting ULIRG-like systems out to z=10. The first paper was <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1211.6668G">Geach et al. (2013).</a>

<h3><a name="writing" class="anchor" href="#writing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Popular writing</h3>

<p>Check out <a
href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-galaxies">"The
Lost Galaxies"</a>, a feature article I wrote for <i>Scientific
American.</i>This article looks at the issue of 'missing baryons', or the
inefficiency of galaxy formation from the standpoint of where most of the gas
ended up.</p>

<h3><a name="viz" class="anchor" href="#viz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h3>

<a href="http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~crain/">Rob Crain</a> and myself have
been developing a set of tools to create bespoke visualizations of
cosmological simulations and volumetric observational data. We have created
fully stereoscopic IMAX-scale movies, and our work has appeared on the front
cover of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09452.html"><i>Nature</i></a>. A
few examples of our work:
