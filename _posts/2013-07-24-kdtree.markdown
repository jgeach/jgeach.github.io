Merging VICS82 J+K[short] with SDSS Stripe 82 photometry and SDSS (III)
spectroscopy (mainly BOSS for QSO redshifts, but some SEGUE serendips in there
too). Getting tens of thousands of galaxy redshifts (z<1), and thousands of
quasar redshifts, typically with z=1-3, but a few very high-z guys in there
too. Good news for the blind search.

Came across the ``scipy.spatial`` kd-tree module for quick finding duplicate
entries (with almost-but-not-quite-the-same co-ordinates). Speed is important,
since the VICS82 catalogue has well over a million entries. Don't worry so
much about cos(dec) term here, since we just care about finding (very) nearest
neighbours:

```python
from scipy import spatial

tol = 0.1/3600 #some small angle in degrees
coords = zip(ra,dec) #ra, dec arrays of coords
tree =  spatial.KDTree(coords) #KDTree instance
#query to return list of tuples of nearest neighbour (r<tol) indices
matches = tree.query_pairs(tol) 

```
