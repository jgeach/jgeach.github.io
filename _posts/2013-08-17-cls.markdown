Excellent progress this week with CLS: new SMP machine (256GB/32 core) with 30TB local store installed and running nicely. Scheduling jobs with minumum required memory for a single continuous chunk and one smurf thread allows much more efficient processing of many scans in parallel.

Working on LBG stacking and LABs in SSA22.
