Inexcusable hiatus in posts... must do better. First purchases of the URF
grant were iPad Air, new MacBook (Air, natch) and 27" Thunderbolt screen. For
the former I have started loading up apps, and what I'm most excited about is
'Paper' by [FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper). It's the closest
thing I've seen to emulating an actual sketch book or note pad, with all the
benefits of tech (gestures to magnify, rewind option, etc.). I'm going to be
using this for sketching out ideas and concepts; I'll post some here.
