<p>Some praise for <i>Galaxy</i>:</p>

<p><blockquote> Astrophysicist Geach goes an order of magnitude
further than the usual popular astronomy title - those full of
breathtaking images, but little in the way of context - by giving
readers the fascinating stories revealed by those images: how galaxies
are created, how they evolve, and what they tell us about our
universe. The sheer variety is stunning: 'grand design' spirals like
our Milky Way; barred spirals; irregular and amorphous galaxies with
no discernible structure; dynamic interacting and colliding galaxies
where new stars form like popcorn; and quasars, ancient, distant
galaxies whose central black holes spew copious amounts of x-ray,
ultraviolet, and visible radiation. Living in the Milky Way gives us
an insider's view of a typical spiral galaxy, with its broad disc of
stars surrounding a bulge or hub of older stars cloaking a
supermassive black hole. Geach explores the technology behind modern
big telescopes—as well as their instrumentation and techniques—that
scientists use to study galaxies as they determine what they're made
of, how much is unknown dark matter, and how fast they're receding
away from us in our expanding universe. Gorgeous color photos, coupled
with clear and engaging explanations of the science behind them, make
this book a winner on every level.

<p><blockquote>Book of the Month... Galaxy: Mapping the Cosmos is a
beautifully illustrated exploration of the Universe beyond the Milky
Way, and the mysteries and wonders of extragalactic astronomy. Geach
is ideally placed to be our guide on this journey - a researcher in
the fastchanging field of galaxy evolution, he displays both breadth
and depth of knowledge, happily matched by a talent for engaging,
nontechnical prose and an eye for a simile... [Galaxy] is an
enthralling, detailed and beautiful look at one of the most
challenging and exciting areas of modern astronomy, and a great
addition to any enthusiast's library.</blockquote><br><p>Sky At Night
Magazine</p>

<p><blockquote>An excellent guide to a world many of us never get to see, both on and off this planet.</blockquote><br><p>Focus Magazine</p>

<p><blockquote>James Geach is actively researching on one of the most exciting
frontiers of today’s science: extragalactic astronomy. His book
conveys his personal enthusiasm, and offers a clear and highly
readable survey of the field’s progress and prospects.</blockquote><br> Professor
Martin Rees FRS, Astronomer Royal, Institute of Astronomy,
Cambridge</p>

<p><blockquote>Dr Geach brings his personal experience to the fore in
describing the latest discoveries in this rapidly developing field of
cosmology and galaxy evolution . . . I highly recommend this book for
those wanting to share in the excitement of modern
astronomy.</blockquote><br> Professor Richard Ellis FRS, California Institute
of Technology</p>

<p><blockquote>Galaxies are the building blocks of the Universe. But they are
dynamic blocks that have changed and evolved throughout the 13 billion
years since their seeds – sown at the very instant of the Big Bang –
began to grow. Their trials and tribulations are recounted with great
clarity in this short, accessible, yet deep and comprehensve
book. What are galaxies made of, why do they have different sizes,
luminosities and morphologies, how have they managed to grow gigantic
black holes in their midst, all these questions are posed – and
answered as far as current knowledge permits – in an engaging and
absorbing way by James Geach. As a practising professional astronomer
at the cutting edge of galaxy research, Geach has managed to convey
the vibrancy and excitement of research at the very forefront of human
knowledge.</blockquote><br> Professor Carlos Frenk FRS, Director of the Institute for
Computational Cosmology, Durham University</p>
