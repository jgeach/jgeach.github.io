<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me and my research</h3>

<p>I am
a <a href="http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research/">Royal
Society University Research Fellow</a> and Reader in Astrophysics
based in
the <a href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/research/stri/research-areas/car.html">Centre
for Astrophysics Research (CAR) at the University of
Hertfordshire</a>. I did my Ph.D. at Durham University under the
expert tutelage of <a href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~irs/">Ian
Smail</a>. After completing my thesis, I was a post-doc at Durham
and <a href="http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html">Banting
Fellow</a>
at <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/index.php">McGill
University</a> before coming to CAR in 2013.

<p> My research focuses on the evolution of galaxies, with a special
emphasis on dust-obscured activity, feedback, the role of environment,
and the properties and evolution of gas in and around galaxies. I'm
also very interested in applications of machine learning in
astrophysics and its potential application elsewhere. For a complete
record of my research, you can find

listing of publications and pre-prints at the NASA Astrophysics Data
System</a>. You can also read about some of my research in the

<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing</h3>

<p>I like trying to break down complex
ideas into simple language, and communicate the cutting edge of
astronomical research, in a way that anyone can understand. I have
written two popular science books, both published by <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk">Reaktion Books</a>:

<br>

<br><a href="galaxy.html"><img src='i/cover.jpg'></a>&nbsp<a href="fivephotons.html"><img src='i/fivephotons.jpg'></a><br>
</p>

<p>I have written feature articles
for <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-galaxies"><i>Scientific
American</i></a> and <a href="https://www.skyandtelescope.com/sky-and-telescope-magazine/inside-april-2018-issue/"><i>Sky & Telescope</i></a>. I regularly contribute
to <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/james-geach-206318/articles"><i>The
Conversation</i></a> and also write the occasional piece
on <a href="https://medium.com/@jgeach">Medium</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="viz" class="anchor" href="#viz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h3>

<a href="http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~crain/">Rob Crain</a> and
myself have been developing a set of tools to create bespoke
visualizations of cosmological simulations and volumetric
observational data. Our work has appeared on the front cover
of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09452.html"><i>Nature</i></a>
and <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Scientific
American</i></a>, and we also contributed to Terrence Malick's <a href="https://voyageoftime.imax.com/"><i>Voyage Of Time</i>
