<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me and my research</h3>

<p>I am
a <a href="http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research/">Royal
Society University Research Fellow</a> and Reader in Astrophysics based in
the <a href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/research/stri/research-areas/car.html">Centre
for Astrophysics Research (CAR) at the University of
Hertfordshire</a>. I did my Ph.D. at Durham University under the
expert tutelage of <a href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~irs/">Ian
Smail</a>. After graduating, I was a post-doc at Durham
and <a href="http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html">Banting
Fellow</a>
at <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/index.php">McGill
University</a> before coming to CAR in 2013.

<p> My research focuses on the evolution of galaxies, with a special
emphasis on obscured activity, the role of environment, and the
properties and evolution of cold gas in and around galaxies. For a
complete record of my research, you can find
an <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-basic_connect?qsearch=geach%2C+j&version=1">up-to-date
listing of publications and pre-prints at the NASA Astrophysics Data
System</a>.

<h3><a name="describe" class="anchor" href="#describe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing</h3>

<p>I like trying to break down complex
ideas into simple language, and communicate the cutting edge of
astronomical research, in a way that anyone can understand. I have
written two popular science books, both published by <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk">Reaktion Books</a>:

<br><a href="galaxy.html"><img src='i/cover.jpg'></a><br>
<a href="fivephotons.html"><img src='i/fivephotons.jpg'></a><br>


<h3><a name="writing" class="anchor"
href="#writing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"\
></span></a>Articles and features</h3>

<p>Check
out <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-galaxies">"The
Lost Galaxies"</a>, a feature article I wrote for <i>Scientific
American.</i>This article looks at the issue of 'missing baryons', or
the inefficiency of galaxy formation from the standpoint of where most
of the gas in the Universe ended up. This article was also featured in
the August 2014 Special Edition of <i>Scientific American</i>
titled <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Secrets
of the Universe: past, present and future</a></i></p>

<p>I also write the occasional piece
on <a href="https://medium.com/@jgeach">Medium</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="viz" class="anchor" href="#viz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h3>

<a href="http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~crain/">Rob Crain</a> and
myself have been developing a set of tools to create bespoke
visualizations of cosmological simulations and volumetric
observational data. We have created fully stereoscopic IMAX-scale
movies, and our work has appeared on the front cover
of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09452.html"><i>Nature</i></a>
and <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/special-editions/"><i>Scientific
American</i></a>. A few examples of our work:
