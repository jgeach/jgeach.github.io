<p>Some praise for <i>Five Photons</i>:</p>

<p><blockquote> Light illuminates cosmic origins and
decodes quotidian realities. But what is it? This deft primer by
astrophysicist James Geach captures the elusive electromagnetic wave
in five processes. His meditation on ‘old’ light takes us back to the
singularity: the “cosmic seed” that expanded into the Big Bang. A
study of starlight plunges us into the seething stellar surface. We
peruse dark energy, radio waves and quasars – beacon-like galaxies in
which supermassive black holes feed off interstellar gas and release
vast amounts of energy. A masterclass in elucidating hard science with
elegance and brevity.</blockquote><br><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06139-0"><i>Nature</i></a></p>

<p><blockquote> Geach's beautiful cosmic biography takes readers on a
sweeping tour of all that was, is, and ever will be. Five Photons is
as elegant as it is enlightening.</blockquote><br><p>Lee Billings,
author of <i>Five Billion Years of Solitude</i></p>


<p><blockquote> With his elegant, supremely clear writing, Geach has
succeeded at creating both a state-of-the-art cosmic overview and a
rather wonderful meditation on the nature of our reality.
</blockquote><br><p>Caleb Scharf,
author of <i>The Zoomable Universe</i></p>
